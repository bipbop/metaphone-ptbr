/* ***************************************
  This is a port of the Metaphone based algorithm for brazilian
  portuguese, developed by Prefeitura Municipal de Varzea Paulista for PHP.


  OBJECTIVES:

  As Metaphone, the ideia is to compute sound like strings, but
  in this case, just for brazilian portuguese. Why? Because would be nice
  to have generic tool for every language, but sometimes is not desirable or
  either maintanable. Any changes could break the original metaphone code, and
  one way of avoiding this is introducing more "alternate" strings. Another one
  is creating specifics metaphone functions for each language. That's my choice

  Information on using Double Metaphone can be found at
        http://www.codeproject.com/string/dmetaphone1.asp
  and the original article describing it can be found at
        http://www.cuj.com/documents/s=8038/cuj0006philips/

  The original port for portuguese can be found here:
